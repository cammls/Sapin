Sapin Project <br />
This project is a Fir tree written in C. <br />
Usage : <br />
Compile the C code: <br />
$ cc sapin.c <br />
You can use directly the executable file a.out or run:<br />
$ make<br />
To generate an executable file named "MonBeauSapin" <br />
Either way, execute the file and give it a number as argument to print the corresponding Fir Tree. For example: <br />
$ ./MonBeauSapin 3 <br />
Will print a fir tree with 3 branches. Have fun!  <br />
